1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Book of Celsus, <a
name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a"
class="citation">[1a]</a> entitled &ldquo;The True
Discourse,&rdquo; <a name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b"
class="citation">[1b]</a> is supposed to have been written during
the fifth persecution, <a name="citation1c"></a><a
href="#footnote1c" class="citation">[1c]</a> in the reign of
Marcus Antoninus, and in the one hundred and seventieth year of
the Christian era.&nbsp; Of his history nothing is known, but
that he was an epicurean philosopher, <a name="citation1d"></a><a
href="#footnote1d" class="citation">[1d]</a> and a friend of
Lucian, who inscribed a book <a name="citation1e"></a><a
href="#footnote1e" class="citation">[1e]</a> to <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>him.&nbsp; The
object of his work was an attack upon Christianity, and as such,
it is one of the most malignant and unreserved upon record.&nbsp;
He is indebted to his opponents for bringing down any account of
his writings to posterity, for they have otherwise perished.</p>
<p>Origen died in the year of our Lord <a
name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a> two hundred and fifty-four.&nbsp; He
undertook, at the request of Ambrose, <a name="citation2b"></a><a
href="#footnote2b" class="citation">[2b]</a> to answer the work
of Celsus, and &ldquo;to leave no part without
examination.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Treatise is divided into eight
books; but this division seems rather to be founded upon caprice,
<a name="citation2c"></a><a href="#footnote2c"
class="citation">[2c]</a> than upon any design of methodically
discussing the argument.&nbsp; The reasonings of Celsus are
discussed in the order in which they occur, which is without
method, or connection.&nbsp; The extracts which are made by
Origen from the works of his adversary are very copious, so much
so, that, considering his object, of fully discussing <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>every part of
the original work, it is probable nothing of importance is
omitted.&nbsp; The accuracy of the quotations of Origin is
guaranteed both by his acknowledged veracity, <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a> and by the risk of refutation to which
he would otherwise have exposed himself, from opponents who had
the original writing in their hands.&nbsp; The work of Origen has
been considered both by ancients and moderns, as a master-piece
of eloquence and argument.&nbsp; Eusebius <a
name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b"
class="citation">[3b]</a> and Jerome <a name="citation3c"></a><a
href="#footnote3c" class="citation">[3c]</a> have given it their
highest approbation.&nbsp; Many of our own writers, <a
name="citation3d"></a><a href="#footnote3d"
class="citation">[3d]</a> and many more of the French, <a
name="citation3e"></a><a href="#footnote3e"
class="citation">[3e]</a> both Catholic and Protestant, have
pronounced it to be the completest, and best written apology for
the Christian Religion which has been bequeathed to us by the
ancients.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The want
of order, both in the attack of Celsus, and the reply of Origen,
renders it impracticable to follow, precisely in their
steps.&nbsp; Time will be gained, and perspicuity promoted, by
endeavouring to bring their perplexed argument into a more
regular form.&nbsp; We shall therefore single out the main topics
discussed by each, and by stating the objections of the one, and
the replies of the other, strive to collect the evidence which
each furnishes to the truth of Christianity.&nbsp; Taking the
more prominent topics therefore, we shall consider in order; the
History and Writings of the Jews&mdash;the Scriptures&mdash;the
History of Christ&mdash;the Conduct and the Principles of the
early Christians.&nbsp; After which it will be useful to sum up
the evidence to Christianity, supplied by the whole argument.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span><span
class="smcap">Chap</span>. I.<br />
HISTORY <i>and</i> WRITINGS <i>of the</i> JEWS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evidence in favour of
Christianity, to be deduced from the history and writings of the
Jews, is so important, that it was a primary object with Celsus,
to render it nugatory.&nbsp; This he endeavours to effect, first,
by disputing the antiquity of Moses; and secondly, by condemning
his narration.&nbsp; We shall examine his statement on these
points, and some important acknowledgments he makes, of the
existence of the prophetic writings.</p>
<p>He says that &ldquo;the Jews, <a name="citation5a"></a><a
href="#footnote5a" class="citation">[5a]</a> who were originally
fugitive slaves from Egypt, pretended, on the authority of the
Books of Moses, to a very ancient genealogy; <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> that they lived together in a corner of
Palestine, in profound ignorance; <a name="citation5c"></a><a
href="#footnote5c" class="citation">[5c]</a> not having heard of
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the things
long before celebrated by Hesiod, and many other men divinely
inspired.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then particularizes much of the history
of Genesis, which he calls &ldquo;an old woman&rsquo;s story,
full of impiety;&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a> and asserts that
&ldquo;many of its facts are taken from the
heathens.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this Origen <a name="citation6b"></a><a
href="#footnote6b" class="citation">[6b]</a> replies by referring
to Josephus <a name="citation6c"></a><a href="#footnote6c"
class="citation">[6c]</a> and Tatian <a name="citation6d"></a><a
href="#footnote6d" class="citation">[6d]</a> for external proof
of the history of the Jews: He affirms that they have all the
evidence of their existence which other nations have, <a
name="citation6e"></a><a href="#footnote6e"
class="citation">[6e]</a> that they have records which others
have not; <a name="citation6f"></a><a href="#footnote6f"
class="citation">[6f]</a> that other nations are allowed to have
existed who bear testimony to the Jews; <a
name="citation6g"></a><a href="#footnote6g"
class="citation">[6g]</a> that it would have been impossible for
so small a band, to have opposed itself to the whole power of
Egypt; that it must have changed its language; and that, in
changing, it has not assumed one resembling the neighbouring
nations.&nbsp; He then urges the wisdom of the Jewish
Institutions; <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>infers from their perfect preservation, the esteem in
which they were held; and challenges a comparison, <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a> as to sublimity of doctrine, and purity
of morals, with any other system, proposed to mankind.</p>
<p>Celsus then notices many of the Old Testament characters: He
ridicules the relation of &ldquo;the Fall, <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a> the Deluge, Children born of old
Persons, Brothers who kill each other, Mothers who deceive, the
Sin of Lot, the Animosity of Esau, the Deceit of the Sons of
Jacob, the History of Joseph,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Origen replies
that such facts alone are selected by Celsus from the writings of
Moses, as supply a ground of attack; that the simplicity of his
narration proves the integrity of its author; and he then
apologizes for these causes of offence by the necessity of the
case, he contrasts with them the greater profligacy of the
heathen, or fancifully explains them upon the scheme of
allegory.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>No direct
admission of Celsus, relating to Jewish prophecy, is to be
found.&nbsp; There are however many observations, which prove the
coming of Christ to have been expected by the Jews, and this
expectation must have been the result of prophecy.&nbsp; The
remarks of Celsus, with regard to this topic, are of this
kind.&nbsp; That the &ldquo;Jews <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a> and Christians
believe, that the Spirit of God had promised there would come a
Saviour; but they could not agree, whether or no, he had already
come;&rdquo; <a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a> that &ldquo;the prophecies which the
Christians apply to Christ refer equally to other persons;&rdquo;
<a name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a> that &ldquo;others had lived who had
applied the prophecies of Christ to themselves,&rdquo; &amp;c.
&amp;c.&nbsp; Thus he plainly admits prophecies to have existed
of some great person, who was to come; and that Jews and
Christians believed in them, but that it was uncertain whether
they were accomplished.</p>
<p>The inferences to be collected from the preceding
observations, are as follows.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>First,
The Jewish Scriptures are of older date, than the birth of
Christ.&nbsp; For if these writings had been compiled since that
time, some rumours of such an event must have reached Celsus; and
this fact which would have ruined all the pretensions of Jewish
antiquity, would have been urged by the heathens as a primary
objection to their claims.&nbsp; The Jews themselves moreover
could not have been deceived, if this had been a cunningly
devised fable; for they were a widely extended people, and in so
short a space of time, it would have been impossible to make them
the dupes of such an imposture.&nbsp; Secondly, It may be
inferred from the admission of Celsus, that the prophecies were
found in the Jewish Scriptures <i>in his time</i>; and
<i>since</i> then no alteration has been made in them by the
Jews.&nbsp; But if so, this is the strongest presumption, that
the Jews had never altered them <i>before</i>.&nbsp; For, if,
when by the fulfilment of the prophecies, in the person of
Christ, they were most tempted to erase predictions, so hostile
to their own creed, they made no <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>change, much less, would they do it,
when the temptation was diminished.&nbsp; Thirdly, If little is
to be collected from the writings of Celsus, in favour of those
prophecies which he has attacked, something may be inferred in
favour of those which he has failed to attack.&nbsp; Their
existence is admitted, and his spirit of hostility is such, that
we must attribute his silence not to his forbearance, but to his
disingenuousness.&nbsp; Fourthly, The admission that some
important character was expected, not only by the Jews, but by
the heathens, at the era of Christ&rsquo;s advent, is very
important to religion.&nbsp; Where could the expectation
originate, except in the Jewish Scriptures?&nbsp; The sages,
poets, and historians of antiquity, appear to have drunk at this
sacred source.&nbsp; The Arabians <a name="citation10a"></a><a
href="#footnote10a" class="citation">[10a]</a> came from a far
country to greet it; Herod destroyed <a name="citation10b"></a><a
href="#footnote10b" class="citation">[10b]</a> the Jewish
genealogies that the family of David might not be known, <a
name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a> undertook the building of the temple,
a work it was thought the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Messias was to perform, and murdered
<a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a> his own son in fear that the promised
King should dethrone him.&nbsp; Virgil, building upon the popular
persuasion, applied it on two occasions to Augustus. <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; This expectation is also
mentioned by Cicero, <a name="citation11c"></a><a
href="#footnote11c" class="citation">[11c]</a> Sallust, <a
name="citation11d"></a><a href="#footnote11d"
class="citation">[11d]</a> Suetonius, <a
name="citation11e"></a><a href="#footnote11e"
class="citation">[11e]</a> and Tacitus. <a
name="citation11f"></a><a href="#footnote11f"
class="citation">[11f]</a>&nbsp; If the origin of this
expectation was with the Jews, where else can we look for the
accomplishment.&nbsp; Who has fulfilled their wide-spread
expectations?&nbsp; Where is this hope of all nations to be
sought, if not in the person of Christ?</p>
<h2><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span><span
class="smcap">Chap</span>. II.<br />
THE SCRIPTURES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Celsus</span> in his general mode of
argument against the Christians, renders a very important
testimony to the truth of their Scriptures: for his charges are
not grounded on facts or doctrines, not there recorded; but
almost every one of them may be directly traced, to some
important and obvious passage of the Bible.</p>
<p>He seemed therefore to consider, that he could most
effectually destroy Christianity, by overturning the authority of
the writings which the Christians believed to have been delivered
to them by inspiration, and which they considered the authority,
the guide and the security of their religion.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>He
acknowledges <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a> that there were &ldquo;writings
concerning the affairs of Christ made by his disciples;&rdquo;
using the word <i>disciple</i> distinctly from the
<i>follower</i> of Christ, and plainly in the sense of the
immediate attendant upon his person.&nbsp; Whence may be inferred
the general belief, in his time, that the Gospels proceeded from
their accredited authors.</p>
<p>He states the Christians to have &ldquo;preached their
doctrines to the poor and wicked, without partiality or respect
of persons;&rdquo; <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a> a statement
admitted by Origen, to be conformable to the genius of the
Gospel, and fulfilling its own declarations, &ldquo;that to the
poor the Gospel is preached;&rdquo; <a name="citation13c"></a><a
href="#footnote13c" class="citation">[13c]</a> and that
&ldquo;Christ came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.&rdquo; <a name="citation13d"></a><a
href="#footnote13d" class="citation">[13d]</a>&nbsp; This
statement also proves the Gospel to have been publicly
promulged.</p>
<p>He charges the Christians with so &ldquo;mutilating the
Scriptures, that if one expression <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>was attacked they might take refuge
in another;&rdquo; <a name="citation14a"></a><a
href="#footnote14a" class="citation">[14a]</a> but the charge
rests alone upon his assertion.&nbsp; Origen confidently
challenges any proof of it; imputes the mutilations of Scripture,
exclusively, to Marcion and Valentinus; but denies their claim to
the title of Christians.</p>
<p>The quotations of Celsus from the New Testament are so
numerous, <a name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> that from them a great part of the
History of Christ, a statement of his doctrines, his character,
and that of his disciples, might be gathered.&nbsp; These
quotations are taken from the Gospels, in general, but more
particularly from Saint Matthew, from the Acts of the Apostles,
from the various Epistles of St. Paul, St. Peter, and St.
John.&nbsp; They are so faithful a transcript of our New
Testament, as to leave no doubt, that he had it before him.&nbsp;
Now and then, however, he mutilates passages, as if to show <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the contempt
in which he held the whole relation.&nbsp; Thus in mentioning the
disciples of Christ, he says, &ldquo;that he took ten or eleven
abjects, vile publicans and sailors.&rdquo; <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; This error is plainly one, rather
of contempt, than of ignorance.</p>
<p>It is also worthy of notice, that Celsus has taken very few
stories from the heretical writings, which assumed to themselves
equal authority with the Gospels, and which abounded in his
days.&nbsp; These stories, wherever they occur, are disallowed by
Origen, and their authors, at once, given up as uninspired.&nbsp;
The concessions of Celsus may be taken in evidence, that the
canon of Scripture was already so well established, that it would
have been in vain for him to mis-state it.</p>
<p>The general testimony furnished by Origen to the Scriptures,
may be viewed in some degree distinctly from that of
Celsus.&nbsp; It must be considered as coming about fifty years
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>after. <a
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; In this work he quotes from
twenty-nine books of the Old Testament, <a
name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a> from all but three in the New, <a
name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"
class="citation">[16c]</a> and from five books of the Apocrypha.
<a name="citation16d"></a><a href="#footnote16d"
class="citation">[16d]</a>&nbsp; His quotations agree very
accurately with our Text, and many passages, which since have
been disputed, <a name="citation16e"></a><a href="#footnote16e"
class="citation">[16e]</a> are held by him as authentic.&nbsp; He
allows no objection to lie against the plenary inspiration of
Scripture; he indeed admits <a name="citation16f"></a><a
href="#footnote16f" class="citation">[16f]</a> some differences
to have existed, as to the interpretation of passages, but
adverts to none respecting their authority.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Origen
frankly avows the <i>difficulties</i> of Scripture; and it is to
cut his way through these, that he is tempted to employ the
weapon of allegorical interpretation; a weapon, which never fails
to wound the hand of the employer, and to injure the cause it is
designed to serve.&nbsp; His rashness in this method of
interpretation may be estimated by the following specimen. <a
name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;O daughter of Babylon,
who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as
thou hast served us.&nbsp; Happy shall he be, who taketh and
dasheth thy little ones against the stones.&rdquo; <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The little ones, the
children of Babylon,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are to be interpreted
vexatious thoughts, the offspring of confusion, which vice has
produced; and he who is happy in dashing them against the stones,
is he, who crushes these thoughts against the solidity of
reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such excesses, whilst they betray the
unsoundness <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>of an expositor of Scripture, evince his faith in its
authority: and it is rather the authority of the text, than the
universal sobriety of its interpreters, which we are anxious to
defend.</p>

HISTORY OF CHRIST.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attack of Celsus, upon the
History of Christ, maybe arranged under the three divisions, of
his birth; his life; his death.</p>
<p>In adverting to the birth of Christ, Celsus introduces a Jew,
charging Christ with being privately born <a
name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a> in a little village of Judea, his
mother being driven out by the Carpenter, to whom she was
betrothed, because convicted of adultery <a
name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a> with a soldier named Panther.&nbsp; He
imputes to him that he was privately educated, and went to earn
his livelihood in Egypt.</p>
<p>It is enough to say of all this, that it is mere assertion;
that no proof of it is either <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>established or offered.&nbsp; Origen,
however, justly asks, if it be probable, that a person, the
purity of whose life and doctrine is so remarkably opposite to
the imputation laid against his birth, <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a> should have been born and educated by
a profligate parent.&nbsp; Perhaps, even the idolatrous worship
of the Virgin Mary, in the Church of Rome, of which the first
elements are discernible at a very early period, may in a measure
serve, (the only good purpose it ever served) to vindicate her
moral character. <a name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a></p>
<p>Against the Life of Christ, no charge is brought by Celsus; <a
name="citation20c"></a><a href="#footnote20c"
class="citation">[20c]</a> except that he did not answer to
<i>his</i> conception <a name="citation20d"></a><a
href="#footnote20d" class="citation">[20d]</a> of the appearance
of a Deity on earth.&nbsp; It is obvious that this objection is
founded on a misconception of the object of his advent.&nbsp;
Celsus believed that other gods had descended <a
name="citation20e"></a><a href="#footnote20e"
class="citation">[20e]</a> from heaven <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>to earth, and framed his notion of
the appearance of deity, upon the model with which the fictions
of heathen poetry and history supplied him.&nbsp; To satisfy his
perverted imagination, <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a> God must descend
in showers of gold, <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a> or armed with
celestial thunders.&nbsp; And indeed had Jesus Christ appeared,
like the gods of heathenism, to gratify lust, or decide the fate
of empires; the ensigns of pomp and power would have been adapted
to his commission.&nbsp; But when it is remembered, that he came
to establish a spiritual religion, <a name="citation21c"></a><a
href="#footnote21c" class="citation">[21c]</a> to wean men from
the world, <a name="citation21d"></a><a href="#footnote21d"
class="citation">[21d]</a> to live with the poor, <a
name="citation21e"></a><a href="#footnote21e"
class="citation">[21e]</a> and above all to die for the guilty;
<a name="citation21f"></a><a href="#footnote21f"
class="citation">[21f]</a> then it is evident, that the character
which became him, was that of a &ldquo;Man of Sorrows.&rdquo; <a
name="citation21g"></a><a href="#footnote21g"
class="citation">[21g]</a>&nbsp; Moral grandeur was the only
grandeur with which he could invest himself, righteousness his
sceptre, <a name="citation21h"></a><a href="#footnote21h"
class="citation">[21h]</a> and his throne a cross.&nbsp; Had
Celsus indeed been disposed to examine, or enabled to appreciate,
the moral dignity of his character, <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>he would have shrunk with disgust
from the fabled descents of Jupiter.&nbsp; He would have seen
that this Pillar of Cloud <a name="citation22a"></a><a
href="#footnote22a" class="citation">[22a]</a> had a bright side;
that if he was a man in suffering, in the grandeur with which he
suffered he was truly God.</p>
<p>Celsus states, even to minuteness, the facts recorded by the
Sacred Historians, as to the Death of Christ.&nbsp; He says, that
he was &ldquo;betrayed,&rdquo; <a name="citation22b"></a><a
href="#footnote22b" class="citation">[22b]</a>
&ldquo;bound,&rdquo; &ldquo;scourged,&rdquo; &ldquo;stretched
upon the Cross;&rdquo; <a name="citation22c"></a><a
href="#footnote22c" class="citation">[22c]</a> that he
&ldquo;drank vinegar;&rdquo; <a name="citation22d"></a><a
href="#footnote22d" class="citation">[22d]</a> that after his
death, he was &ldquo;said to have appeared twice,&rdquo; <a
name="citation22e"></a><a href="#footnote22e"
class="citation">[22e]</a> but that &ldquo;he did not appear to
his enemies.&rdquo; <a name="citation22f"></a><a
href="#footnote22f" class="citation">[22f]</a>&nbsp; To the
objection conveyed in the last clause it is an obvious reply,
that his appearance to his enemies cannot be claimed, except by
those who contend that God is bound to increase evidence to the
persons who shut their eyes against it.&nbsp; Those who, after
the evidence of the miracles of <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Jesus Christ, could continue to
doubt, would not have believed, though he &ldquo;had risen from
the dead&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> in their view.</p>
<p>The objections of Celsus to the character of Christ being thus
dismissed, and they are really unworthy even of the scanty space
here bestowed upon them, it is plain that all the <i>facts</i>
admitted by him are so much to be added to the scale of
evidence.&nbsp; It is thus proved, that, either influenced by
universal persuasion, or borne down by overwhelming testimony,
men, who desired to be infidels, were compelled to admit the
facts of Christianity.&nbsp; It is also proved, that nothing can
be charged against the life of Christ, except that he most
accurately maintained the character in which he condescended to
appear.</p>

MIRACLES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> strongest evidence in favour of
Christianity is supplied by the Miracles, which accompanied its
promulgation.&nbsp; We shall proceed to consider the light cast
by the work before us, on this important topic; and examine,
first, the testimony of Origen and Celsus to the miraculous
effects that were produced; secondly, the pretensions which these
works had to a Divine original.</p>
<p>Celsus lived in an age when by the testimony of all history,
the Miracles of Christ were objects of notoriety.&nbsp; The
disciples had yet the power of working them, <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> and they propounded <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a> them as the incontrovertible <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>proof of the
truth of their religion.&nbsp; It was impossible therefore, in a
general work against Christianity, that Celsus should not refer
to the subject of Miracles, or that he should, in the face of
their public performance, flatly deny their existence.&nbsp; He
has then taken the only method by which he could obviate this
difficulty.&nbsp; He makes a &ldquo;<i>supposition</i> <a
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a> that Christ did perform many
marvellous works;&rdquo; these however he imputes to &ldquo;the
same magical power that is made use of in the market-places of
Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall first examine how far this
concession on the part of Celsus may stand as an admission that
Miracles were really performed.&nbsp; Writers have differed about
the meaning to be attached to these words; but the greater part
of those, whose opinion is of highest authority, <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a> have considered them as an
acknowledgment that these wonderful works could not be denied by
him.&nbsp; Considering the peculiarly difficult circumstances in
which Celsus was placed, he <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>could, by a supposition of this kind
alone, escape from the dilemma; and as he did not dare on such a
subject to assert a falsehood, he endeavoured at least to excite
a doubt.&nbsp; This opinion is moreover strengthened by the line
of argument he pursues, &ldquo;that if the by-standers had really
thought these works to be Miracles, they could not but have
believed;&rdquo; then he proceeds to undervalue the worth of
these performances, by comparing them with those of
&AElig;sculapius. <a name="citation26a"></a><a
href="#footnote26a" class="citation">[26a]</a></p>
<p>After reading the passage, in which our Lord foretells that
&ldquo;many should come in his name, doing many wondrous
things;&rdquo; <a name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a> he exclaims, &ldquo;how great is the
force of truth!&mdash;Christ carries with him his own refutation,
for he acknowledges a certain Satan, should work the same
miracles that he did.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this objection it may be
observed, that it cuts two ways.&nbsp; If it invalidates the
Miracles of Christ, yet the event corresponding with the <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>prediction
establishes his prophetical character, and thus authenticates his
religion.</p>
<p>Origen continually proclaims, <a name="citation27a"></a><a
href="#footnote27a" class="citation">[27a]</a> in bold and
eloquent language, in the name of himself, and his fellow
Christians, their faith in Christianity to be founded upon
miracles, wrought in the name of Christ; of which <a
name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a> they themselves had been
eye-witnesses.</p>
<p>It may be asked whether modern infidels who have ventured to
contradict the Miracles of Christ, a weapon Celsus was afraid to
take up, have estimated the rashness of their enterprize.&nbsp;
Are they competent to deny what a spectator no less malevolent
than themselves was compelled to admit.&nbsp; Has the lapse of
eighteen hundred years enabled them to ascertain a fact of daily
occurrence with more accuracy than a by-stander?&nbsp; Are
objects best seen at the greatest distance?</p>
<p>Having then stated the admission of the occurrence of certain
supernatural events, <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>both by the friend, and enemy of
Christianity; we shall say a few words upon the <i>source</i>, to
which they are ascribed by Celsus.</p>
<p>Origen, in considering this topic, admits <a
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a> the faculty of healing to be not
necessarily divine; but says, that the nature of the power by
which wonders of this kind were performed, must be ascertained,
first, by the character of the agent, and secondly, by the nature
of the fact.&nbsp; He then shews that the Miracles of Christ <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a> were not wrought like those of the
Egyptians, for vain exhibition; that their object was to heal
disease, or to assuage grief; and that those miracles, more
peculiarly characteristic of their ministry, namely, the
conversion of the heart from sin to God, <a
name="citation28c"></a><a href="#footnote28c"
class="citation">[28c]</a> were such as the magicians neither
felt the disposition nor professed the power to perform.</p>
<p>The question however may be differently argued.&nbsp; All
miracles, and therefore those of Egypt, must be allowed to
originate in the <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>permission of God.&nbsp; For as the strongest proof of
the existence of the Deity is the creation and regular course of
nature, so, that this proof may remain, the suspension of the
power of nature must also be attributed to him.&nbsp; There is
the same proof, that miracles were performed by the power of God,
as that the world was made, and is regulated by him.</p>
<p>If, however, it is admitted, that the Divine Being has, under
certain circumstances, permitted the influence of Satanic agency:
it will still be evident that the miracles of Christianity were
not works of this class.&nbsp; To suppose that they were, would
involve a variety of conclusions, unsupported by reason or
analogy.</p>
<p>For, if they were, then God, contrary to the whole course of
his dispensations, has suffered his laws to be suspended, in
order to betray millions of his creatures, for a succession of
ages, into a false theology.&mdash;If they were; then, contrary
also to all precedent, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>he has suffered the interpositions of
devils to outstrip his own.&nbsp; Even the magicians of Egypt, <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a> were compelled to recognise the
supremacy of God.&mdash;If they were; then, contrary to all
experience, a large body of men, through a long period of time,
have been found willing to incur reproach, <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> to endure pain, and even to suffer
death, in the support of miracles which they knew to be the
grossest frauds.&mdash;If they were; then the kingdom of Satan <a
name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a> must, in the most signal manner, have
been &ldquo;divided against itself;&rdquo; since, upon this
hypothesis, miracles which were wrought by devils, were employed
to dispossess them, and finally accomplished the subversion of
the Pagan Mythology, the most formidable system of machinery, by
which Satan ever perpetrated his designs upon mankind.</p>
<p>The evidence then furnished by this Work, on the subject of
Miracles, is considerable.&nbsp; <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Celsus admits their existence; Origen
appeals to them, as what he, and many others had seen.&nbsp;
There is indeed incontrovertible evidence for their existence,
till the conversion of the Roman Empire invested Christianity
with temporal power, and raised her to universal dominion.&nbsp;
With the necessity, the possession of the miraculous powers
ceased.&nbsp; From this period the Gospel was left to the
ordinary grace of God, to its own resources, and to the human
powers of its followers.&nbsp; When a body of illiterate
fishermen were commissioned to publish it to all nations, then
God supplied the powers by which all men &ldquo;heard them speak
in their own language.&rdquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; Now that
learning and wealth are the handmaids of religion, they are left
in a great measure to do the work of miracles.&nbsp; All our
faculties should be therefore bent to this sacred cause, and all
our spoils be offered at the foot of the cross.&nbsp; Nor is the
evidence furnished even now to Christianity through <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the channel
of miracles by any means small.&nbsp; Although miracles of one
class have ceased, men may see in the true Christian, the
greatest of all miracles; a man by nature, cold, corrupt,
indolent, selfish, transformed under the creative hand of the
Gospel, into the bold, generous, active, disinterested,
enterprizing, apostle of truth.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span><span
class="smcap">Chap</span>. V.<br />
CHARACTER <i>of the</i> EARLY CHRISTIANS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the character of an
individual, professing a particular faith, is not sufficient of
itself either to establish, or condemn his creed, the character
of a whole body, professedly living under the influence of the
same principles, bears the most convincing testimony, either for,
or against them.&nbsp; Accordingly the mixed indolence,
sensuality, and ferocity of the Mahometan character, have always
been deemed a sufficient objection, to the principles of the
Koran.&nbsp; And the ancient Christian writers tell us, that the
arm of their tormentors, was sometimes suspended, by the purity
of the Christian victim: and that they heard with astonishment
men supplicating blessings on the heads of their
persecutors.&nbsp; Now it may be of importance to enquire, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>what
testimony is supplied by the work of Origen, to the character of
the early Christians, and, through them, to religion itself.</p>
<p>Celsus objects to the Christians, that they invited every
person, <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a> however ignorant, or simple, or
wretched, or wicked, to their mysteries; and thereby made such a
society, as was fit only for a company of thieves.</p>
<p>To this Origen replies by admitting their willingness to
receive every body into their society.&nbsp; He glories in their
desire, to give knowledge to the ignorant, wisdom to the simple,
peace to the wretched, and reformation to the wicked.&nbsp; He
says that &ldquo;all are cordially received; and food
administered, according to their different wants.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But he adds, that, as the great object of Christianity was
conversion from sin, <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a> so, before any
were allowed to partake of the mysteries of religion, they were
subjected to considerable trial; that <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the very acceptance of Christianity
implied a conversion from these sins, and that if the converts of
the Christians <a name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a> were examined, they would be found far
better than the rest of men.</p>
<p>Some of the other objections serve, in a striking manner, to
shew the superiority both of Christianity and its followers, to
the prevailing system and current characters of the day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now a days,&rdquo; <a name="citation35b"></a><a
href="#footnote35b" class="citation">[35b]</a> says he,
&ldquo;you die with Christ;&rdquo; you teach <a
name="citation35c"></a><a href="#footnote35c"
class="citation">[35c]</a> such precepts as &ldquo;resist not
injuries.&rdquo;&nbsp; This charge Origen is naturally unwilling
to refute.&nbsp; He admits that such is the genius of his
religion, that many Christians devote themselves to perpetual
celibacy; &ldquo;We renounce luxury <a name="citation35d"></a><a
href="#footnote35d" class="citation">[35d]</a> to devote
ourselves to God; we expose our body <a name="citation35e"></a><a
href="#footnote35e" class="citation">[35e]</a> to all manner of
sufferings; and are strangled like sheep without daring to
resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>In
order to repel some charges of Celsus, against the Christians, as
subjects, and citizens, Origen appeals to the evidence of facts;
institutes a comparison between the Christians and the heathens,
<a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a> under the same government, at Athens,
Corinth, and other cities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their religion,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;teaches, that union with God, and each other, is
supreme happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celsus charges them with holding secret assemblies. <a
name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a> His opponent, whilst he invites
enquiry into the nature and conduct of these meetings, asks if
their actual circumstances did not debar them from meeting in any
other manner.</p>
<p>He objects to them also, that they have no temples of worship;
<a name="citation36c"></a><a href="#footnote36c"
class="citation">[36c]</a> but is at once refuted, by a statement
of the impossibility of erecting them.&nbsp; The error also is
stated, of imagining <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>that God can dwell in temples made
with hands; and the sublime article <a name="citation37a"></a><a
href="#footnote37a" class="citation">[37a]</a> of our creed
avowed, that the &ldquo;heaven of heavens cannot contain
him!&rdquo; <a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b"
class="citation">[37b]</a></p>
<p>While therefore, the paucity and weakness of the charges
alleged by the enemies of Christianity, against its followers, is
established by this work, much is incidentally advanced, which
substantiates the superiority of the character of
Christians.&nbsp; They had indeed degenerated even in the days of
Celsus.&nbsp; The stream had not flowed even thus far, without
being tinged with many impurities.&nbsp; But enough virtue was
left to vindicate the religion; enough to enable her champions to
demonstrate the superior efficacy of the faith, because it made
the best citizens and the most useful men.</p>
<p>The allegations of Celsus, and the defence of Origen, alike
prove the extent of the sufferings <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to which the Christians were
subjected.&nbsp; And it may be truly said, that the best defence
of Christianity is written with the blood of its persecuted
followers.&nbsp; It is not credible, that those should either be
deceived, or conspire to deceive others, whose lives were almost
necessarily to pay the forfeit of their mistake, or of their
stratagem.</p>

DOCTRINES <i>of the</i> EARLY CHRISTIANS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be a material defect in an
Essay purporting to state the contents of the reply of Origen to
Celsus, and the evidence supplied by it in favour of
Christianity, not to notice the doctrines of the early
Christians, as they may be collected from the work before us.</p>
<p>In the first place then it appears, both from the objections
of the one, and the direct assertion of the other, that the
Christians of that age admitted in the fullest sense the Divinity
of Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them,&rdquo; says Celsus,
&ldquo;account him an angel, but is he the first and only one
that is come?&rdquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; Hence it is
plain, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>that however Celsus might confound angels and Christ,
the Christians did not.</p>
<p>The assertions of Origen however are unequivocal, and
decisive.&nbsp; Three distinct propositions form a prominent part
<a name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a> in his writings.&nbsp; First, That
Christ was
(&#7936;&gamma;&#8051;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;)
uncreated.&nbsp; Secondly, That the Maker of the World is to be
worshipped.&nbsp; Thirdly, That Christ is the Maker of the
World.&nbsp; As to the first point it is sufficient to refer to a
passage where Jesus Christ is expressly called the
&ldquo;uncreated Son of God.&rdquo; <a name="citation40b"></a><a
href="#footnote40b" class="citation">[40b]</a>&nbsp; He preserves
a precise distinction between creatures,
(&delta;&eta;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&gamma;&eta;&mu;&#8049;&tau;&alpha;)
and their Creator; and he brings <a name="citation40c"></a><a
href="#footnote40c" class="citation">[40c]</a> them together into
comparison as to the respect that is due to them.&nbsp; In the
next place he says that we ought to worship <a
name="citation40d"></a><a href="#footnote40d"
class="citation">[40d]</a> no creatures
(&delta;&eta;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&gamma;&eta;&mu;&#8049;&tau;&alpha;),
but the Creator; <a name="citation40e"></a><a href="#footnote40e"
class="citation">[40e]</a> that we can only lift up our eyes <a
name="citation40f"></a><a href="#footnote40f"
class="citation">[40f]</a> to the Creator of all the magnificence
of Nature, to see whom we ought to admire, serve, and <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>adore.&nbsp;
Then he proclaims Jesus Christ <a name="citation41a"></a><a
href="#footnote41a" class="citation">[41a]</a> as the Creator of
the Universe; that God working with him said at the creation,
&ldquo;Let there be Light, let <i>us</i> make Man.&rdquo; <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a>&nbsp; But Origen is yet more distinct
in the statement of his opinions.&nbsp; He says that the Father
is indeed eminently God; <a name="citation41c"></a><a
href="#footnote41c" class="citation">[41c]</a> but that the
worship of the Son <a name="citation41d"></a><a
href="#footnote41d" class="citation">[41d]</a> is not an inferior
but a Divine worship; he applies the same expression to the
adoration of Jesus Christ <a name="citation41e"></a><a
href="#footnote41e" class="citation">[41e]</a> by the Magi that
he does to the worship of God; he speaks of the Father <a
name="citation41f"></a><a href="#footnote41f"
class="citation">[41f]</a> and the Son being jointly worshipped
as one God; he admits <a name="citation41g"></a><a
href="#footnote41g" class="citation">[41g]</a> the worship of the
Son in his distinct individual character; he attributes to him
immutability, <a name="citation41h"></a><a href="#footnote41h"
class="citation">[41h]</a> omnipresence, <a
name="citation41i"></a><a href="#footnote41i"
class="citation">[41i]</a> and other qualities <a
name="citation41j"></a><a href="#footnote41j"
class="citation">[41j]</a> which are characteristic only of the
Most High. <a name="citation41k"></a><a href="#footnote41k"
class="citation">[41k]</a></p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>The
personality of the Holy Ghost is distinctly admitted by Origen;
<a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a> and his <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>descent upon earth at the day of
Pentecost.&nbsp; He also frequently asserts, that miracles were
performed upon earth by the agency <a name="citation43a"></a><a
href="#footnote43a" class="citation">[43a]</a> of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p>To the doctrine of the Atonement continual references are
made.</p>
<p>The recognition is not less distinct, both by Celsus, and
Origen, of the doctrine of Justification by Faith, as the opinion
of the early Christians.&nbsp; &ldquo;You tell sinners,&rdquo;
says Celsus, &ldquo;not to examine, but believe; and their faith
will save them.&rdquo; <a name="citation43b"></a><a
href="#footnote43b" class="citation">[43b]</a>&nbsp; This is
precisely the language in which an uncandid opponent might be
expected to state that doctrine.&nbsp; A more patient examination
of the system would have taught him, that &ldquo;examine
yourselves,&rdquo; <a name="citation43c"></a><a
href="#footnote43c" class="citation">[43c]</a> and &ldquo;search
the Scriptures,&rdquo; <a name="citation43d"></a><a
href="#footnote43d" class="citation">[43d]</a> were lessons
taught by the same Master who insisted upon the efficacy of a
true and living faith.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>There
are two doctrines, original sin, and the eternity of punishment,
as to one of which the language of Origen is contradictory, and
as to the other it is heterodox.</p>
<p>On the doctrine of original sin, he asserts, in one place,
&ldquo;that no soul came vicious from the hands of God, <a
name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a> but that many persons so corrupt
themselves by bad education, or example, or advice, that sin
becomes as it were natural; but that it is not very difficult,
much less impossible to conquer this, corruption by the word of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the latter clause he supposes the assistance
of the Spirit of God, because he elsewhere says, &ldquo;We cannot
give ourselves a pure heart, without the help of the Holy Spirit:
<a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a> we must therefore pray, Create in me a
new heart, O God.&rdquo; <a name="citation44c"></a><a
href="#footnote44c" class="citation">[44c]</a>&nbsp; He
acknowledges in another place that Adam sinned, and that we, in
our bodies, <a name="citation44d"></a><a href="#footnote44d"
class="citation">[44d]</a> are naturally prone to sin by our
descent from him.&nbsp; Celsus states the doctrine after the <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>manner of the
Fatalists; asserting an original bias to evil, and accounting
that bias to be insurmountable.</p>
<p>The language of Origen as to the doctrine of future
punishments is so obscure, as to make it difficult to determine
what were his opinions.&nbsp; He seems however, in general to
speak the language <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> of Plato, upon a state of future
existence, rather than that of Christ; and to furnish a
convenient basis for the doctrine of purgatory, which the Church
of Rome afterwards introduced among the credenda of
Christianity.&nbsp; Although he distinctly states his own opinion
upon this subject, yet he treats it with a caution almost
amounting to suspicion, as to its practical consequences.&nbsp;
This proves to us two things.&nbsp; First, That a belief of the
eternity of future punishment was generally held by the
Christians, or he would have stated his own opinion without
reserve.&nbsp; Secondly, That Origen in some <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>measure
apprehended that the doctrine on this subject which he held, was
not consistent in its operation with that gospel, which teaches
that, &ldquo;denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
life.&rdquo; <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a>&nbsp; Could he fear this and yet be
firmly convinced of the truth of his own doctrines?&nbsp; Could
he believe that the different parts of Christianity had an
opposite tendency&mdash;that its Almighty framer would pull down
with one arm what he erected with the other.&nbsp; It is
remarkable that we learn from Celsus, what Origen as to this
point might not have taught us; that the eternity of punishments
was the common faith of the Christian Church.&nbsp; His words
are, &ldquo;They (the Christians) persuade themselves that the
good, <a name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a> after this life, shall be happy, the
wicked shall be plunged into everlasting wretchedness: from which
opinion, neither let them, nor any other mortal
depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Such is
a slight sketch of the doctrines of Christianity, as held by the
Church at the period when this work was written.</p>
<p>That the faith of those times is the faith of the purest
Churches in our own days, that the creed of one century is the
creed of many ages, in itself, affords very convincing testimony
to our religion.</p>
<p>The sameness of the faith, proves in the first place, the
integrity of the Scriptures from which it is drawn.&nbsp; It
proves also, that it is, by one and the same Divine Spirit, that
all true Christians, in all successive periods, are taught and
influenced.&mdash;It proves that Christians, instead of yielding
themselves like the heathens, disciples to every succeeding
philosopher, and &ldquo;calling many men master,&rdquo; have
called only one their &ldquo;teacher,&rdquo; their
&ldquo;guide,&rdquo; their &ldquo;master,&rdquo; which is
God.&nbsp; It proves the superiority of Christianity to time and
place; that it is a religion suited to all men, in all ages, and
in all circumstances, and <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>that it therefore bears the impress
of a religion sent from God, and designed to be the faith of the
universe.&nbsp; It enables us lastly, to consider our Creed, not
as the conception of a solitary enthusiast, not a cunningly
devised fable, or the scheme of an ambitious innovator; but to
cast ourselves back, as it were, upon the faith of nations, and
lay hold confidently of that Tree of Life which was planted by
Christ, and whose fruit has been gathered by the hand, and whose
root has been fed by the blood of saints in all ages.</p>

CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus noticed, in succession,
the several topics which are chiefly insisted on in the Work
before us; and having endeavoured to deduce from each, the
distinct evidence in favour of Christianity, which it seemed to
afford, it remains only to sum up the general testimony thus
borne to our religion.</p>
<p>Let the evidence be first considered, which arises from the
concessions and objections of Celsus.&nbsp; In the first place
then he proves the existence of the Scriptures in his own times,
he relates some facts extracted from them, and he corroborates
many others, which would otherwise stand upon their unsupported
authority; and thus he authenticates both the religion, and the
Bible.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>In the
next place, as Celsus is usually considered the most subtle and
malignant of the assailants of Christianity, the weakness of his
assault discovers the difficulty of the attack, or, in other
words, the strength of the religion.</p>
<p>In the third place, his admission of many facts, which he
would have rejoiced to deny, is a strong testimony to the general
belief of the facts, at the period at which he wrote.</p>
<p>Fourthly, His wary suppression of some circumstances
incontrovertibly established by the authority of other persons,
of much evidence which strengthened, and many writers who had
served the Christian cause, <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a> betrays his
conviction that such facts could not be promulgated with safety
to his argument.</p>
<p>Let us turn next to the reasonings and the reply of Origen,
and to the evidence for Christianity supplied by them.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>In the
first place, as the infidel may find in the objections, all the
weapons by which he is now accustomed to assault religion, so the
believer may find in the answers of Origen, the shield which has
repelled, and is sufficient to repel them for ever.</p>
<p>The confidence with which Origen appeals to the Scriptures,
evinces the reverence in which they were held at an age when
their spuriousness, if they had not been genuine, could so
readily have been detected.</p>
<p>The exact correspondence of the Scriptural passages extracted
by him, with our own copies, establishes the integrity of the
sacred canon.</p>
<p>The confidence with which he challenges an investigation of
the miracles, and the miraculous powers of the Church, for some
ages, leaves us no room to doubt of their existence.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>The
firm faith of such a man as Origen, at a period when the evidence
of Christianity lay most open to a scrutiny, is no small
testimony of the truth of the religion.</p>
<p>The very rashness which is charged, and justly charged upon
Origen, is so far satisfactory, that it assures us, the friends
of Christianity, however injudicious, could open no avenues of
attack through which the most dextrous adversaries could
successfully assault the citadel of our faith.</p>
<p>Finally, The effect wrought upon the character of Origen, and
his contemporaries, to which he continually refers, at once gives
weight to their testimony, and vindicates the claim set up by
Christianity, to a Divine efficacy accompanying its
doctrines.&nbsp; Let Origen himself be examined.&nbsp; Such was
his superiority to worldly attraction, that he <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> was content to live and die, a humble
catechist at <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>Alexandria.&nbsp; Such was his devotion to the sacred
cause, that he sold <a name="citation53a"></a><a
href="#footnote53a" class="citation">[53a]</a> his possessions
for a daily allowance that would enable him to pursue the duties
of piety and usefulness, without distraction.&nbsp; Such was his
zeal, that he is said to have bequeathed to his fellow-creatures
six thousand volumes, <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a> the fruits of his
own labour.&nbsp; Nor is his character a solitary instance, upon
the annals of Christianity.&nbsp; The great mass of individuals
who drank at or near the fountain-head of the religion, were
evidently &ldquo;made whole.&rdquo; <a name="citation53c"></a><a
href="#footnote53c" class="citation">[53c]</a>&nbsp; They were
animated by another spirit, and quickened into another
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old things passed away, and all things became
new.&rdquo; <a name="citation53d"></a><a href="#footnote53d"
class="citation">[53d]</a>&nbsp; It was moreover in the power of
these men to examine the sources of objection which were opened
to them by Celsus; this they had certainly done, but their belief
gathered strength by enquiry, <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and they sealed their testimony by
their blood.&nbsp; We have in their conduct a proof of the
impression which the arguments of Celsus made on their minds.</p>
<p>Paganism began to tremble, when she saw that the new religion
was not only a new creed, but <i>a new power</i>; she anticipated
her own downfall when she exclaimed, &ldquo;See how these
Christians love one another.&rdquo;&nbsp; This evidence is
peculiar to the Gospel.&nbsp; By this, under the Divine aid, it
ascended the throne, and grasped the sceptre of the world.&nbsp;
By this it will continue to conquer, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, the reply of Origen to Celsus may be
considered as one of the most valuable legacies of
antiquity.&nbsp; The importance of the subject, the talents of
the contending authors, the ample evidence it affords to our
faith, claim for it our earnest consideration; the errors of
Origen are such as a little sagacity may correct, his merit will
ever be confessed, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>while religion shall need an apology, or talent and
piety have any claim to admiration.&nbsp; It is true that the
revolution of ages has afforded, as might be expected, to truth
additional evidence, and to error fresh refutation.&nbsp; So much
however was effected, in their distinct enterprizes by the early
enemies and friends of Christianity, that the vanity of
unbelievers should be subdued, by discovering most of their
objections to have been before advanced, and the faith of
Christians should be confirmed, by knowing them to have been long
since refuted.</p>

class="footnote">[41k]</a>&nbsp; It may be observed, that
although charges were laid against some of Origen&rsquo;s
doctrines after his death, none were made against his orthodoxy
on the subject of the Trinity, till after the time of
Arius.&nbsp; The Eustathians then opposed him on the ground of
some expressions which he had used against the Sabellians, by
which he separated the hypostases of the Godhead.&nbsp; His
orthodoxy was however maintained by St. Gregory Nazianzen, St.
Basil, St. Athanasius, Chrysostom, and Didymus.&nbsp; The words
of St. Athanasius are &ldquo;Verbum autem ab &aelig;terno esse
cum patre, nec alterius substanti&aelig; vel hypostasis, sed
ipsius patern&aelig; substanti&aelig; proprium illum esse,
quemadmodum dixerunt qui interfuerunt Synodo, liceat nobis rursus
audire etiam ex laborioso Origine.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Op. Athan.</i>
T. 1. p. 277.</p>
<p>Jerome about the year 390 said of Origen, &ldquo;Quem post
Apostolos, Ecclesiarum Magistrum nemo nisi imperitus
negabat.&nbsp; <i>Pr&aelig;f. ad nom. Heb.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; His
celebrated controversy with Ruffinus then began, and as the
latter was an admirer and translator of Origen&rsquo;s writings,
the character of Origen was involved in the dispute, and Jerome
heaped upon it all the abuse he thought due to Ruffinus.&nbsp;
Bishop Bull says of this transaction, &ldquo;Hieronymus
odi&ocirc; su&ocirc; in Originem seu poti&ugrave;s in Origenis
interpretem Ruffinum, nimi&ugrave;m indulgens, indeque omnia ejus
verba dictaque in pessimum sensum trahere
amans.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bullii. Op. Om.</i> p. 121.&nbsp; And
again, &ldquo;Hieronymus in hac Origenis accusatione, animum
&agrave; candore alienum atque affectibus abreptum ita
manifest&egrave; prodidit, ut in c&aelig;teris criminationibus
fidem sibi omnem derog&acirc;sse
videatur.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bullii. Op. Om.</i> p. 123.</p>
<p>Milner (<i>Ecc. Hist.</i> I. 496) observes that the Arians who
had so very little assistance from precedents, were glad to catch
at the shadow of an argument drawn from Origen&rsquo;s
illustrious name, and they accordingly sought out expressions
obscure in themselves, but plainly contradictory to the general
tenor of his opinions, upon the ground of which they claim him as
their supporter.&nbsp; Milner observes of these men (<i>Ecc.
Hist.</i> II. 163) that every thing mean and sordid, cruel and
inhuman, ambitious and perfidious is on their side, and this is
the character of their conduct towards the writings of
Origen.</p>
<p>Of modern writers the opinion is decisive.&nbsp; Bishop Bull
says, &ldquo;Ita mecum statuo Origenem in articulo de fillii
divinitate adeoque de S. Trinitate revera Catholicum
fuisse.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bullii. Op. Om.</i> p. 127.&nbsp;
Waterland, Chandler, Fiddes, and Cudworth hold the same
sentiment.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
